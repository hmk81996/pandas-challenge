#Summary
The Spending_Summary shows that school spending per capita does not seem to improve student scores - in math, reading or overall. In fact, schools that spend less per capita seem to correlate to higher test scores.
The Size_Summary shows that schools with a Large population tend to result in lower test scores while Medium and Small schools result in higher test scores.
The School_Type table shows that between Charter and District schools, the former produced higher test scores in every category. The % Overall Passing showed the greatest difference: Charter schools were at 90% while District schools lagged behind at 54%.

#Conclusions

We can conclude that school spending is not a large factor in improving test scores. The two most important factors in this data set are size and school type: small and medium schools result in higher test scores than large schools while charter Schools significatnly out perform district schools.
