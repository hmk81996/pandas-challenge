#Summary

The Spending_Summary shows that school spending per capita does not seem to consistently affect student scores - in math, reading or overall. In fact, schools that spend less per capita tend to correlate to higher test scores. For example, schools with a spending range of $630 or less per student produced average scores and passing percentages in math, reading and overall that consistently exceeded schools who spent between $630-$680 per student.
  
The Size_Summary shows that schools with a Large population tend to result in lower test scores while Medium and Small schools result in higher test scores. One of the most significant differences was in % Overall Passing: about 58.3% of students in large schools passed overall compared to 90.6% in medium schools and 89.9% in small schools.

The School_Type table shows that between Charter and District schools, the former produced higher test scores in every category. The % Overall Passing showed the greatest difference: Charter schools were at 90.4% while District schools lagged behind at 53.7%.

#Conclusions

We can conclude that school spending is not a large factor in improving test scores. The two most important factors in this data set are size and school type: small and medium schools result in higher test scores than large schools and charter schools significantly out-perform district schools.
